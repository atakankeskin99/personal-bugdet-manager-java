# Personal Budget Manager

A console-based Java application designed to help users track income, expenses, and financial summaries.  
This project was intentionally developed as a learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of the Java programming language, OOP structures, file I/O operations, and the process of designing a small-scale but well-architected application.  
It reflects both the knowledge I gained and my ability to interpret, structure, and implement Java concepts in a practical way.

## Learning Focus and Motivation

This project was created to:

- Improve my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- Practice separation of concerns through multi-class architecture
- Work with file I/O operations in a real application
- Serialize and deserialize object data using a CSV format
- Build a fully interactive console system from scratch
- Develop the ability to interpret a problem and convert it into an executable Java solution

The project serves as both a learning output and a practical demonstration of key Java concepts.
